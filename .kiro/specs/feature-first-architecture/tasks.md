## Success Criteria Verification

After completing all tasks, verify:

- ✅ All code is organized in the new feature-first structure
- ✅ All import references are updated and working
- ✅ The application builds and runs without errors
- ✅ All existing functionality works identically to before
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- ✅ Path aliases are properly configured and working
- ✅ Features are properly isolated with minimal cross-dependencies
- ✅ Shared code is easily accessible from all features

## Risk Mitigation

- **Import Errors**: Each phase includes validation steps to catch broken imports early
- **Broken Functionality**: Comprehensive testing after each major migration phase
- **Build Issues**: Configuration updates are done first before moving code
- **Merge Conflicts**: Migration is designed as a single comprehensive change

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to migrating the entire codebase to a feature-first architecture while maintaining all existing functionality.
