# Feature-First Architecture Migration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration from the current feature-type organization to a feature-first architecture for the AllInOne React Native application. The goal is to improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability by grouping related functionality together rather than separating by technical concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Directory Structure Reorganization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code related to a specific feature to be co-located in a single directory, so that I can easily find, modify, and maintain feature-specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL create a `src/features/` directory structure
2. WHEN creating feature modules THEN each feature SHALL have its own subdirectory under `src/features/`
3. WHEN organizing feature code THEN each feature directory SHALL contain subdirectories for `components/`, `screens/`, `services/`, `store/`, `types/`, and `utils/`
4. WHEN identifying features THEN the system SHALL create the following feature modules:
   - `features/transactions/` - Financial tracking functionality
   - `features/instagram/` - Social media analytics functionality
   - `features/wtregistry/` - Wing Tsun registry functionality
   - `features/calendar/` - Calendar and scheduling functionality
   - `features/notes/` - Note-taking functionality
   - `features/tasks/` - Task management functionality
   - `features/history/` - Activity history functionality

### Requirement 2: Shared Code Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want common/shared code to be easily accessible and clearly separated from feature-specific code, so that I can reuse components and services across multiple features without duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing shared code THEN the system SHALL create a `src/shared/` directory
2. WHEN categorizing shared code THEN the shared directory SHALL contain:
   - `shared/components/` - Reusable UI components
   - `shared/services/` - Cross-cutting services (API, Firebase, Auth)
   - `shared/store/` - Global store configuration and root reducer
   - `shared/types/` - Global TypeScript interfaces and types
   - `shared/utils/` - Cross-cutting utility functions
   - `shared/hooks/` - Shared custom React hooks
3. WHEN organizing shared services THEN the system SHALL create subdirectories:
   - `shared/services/api/` - Base API client configuration
   - `shared/services/firebase/` - Firebase/Firestore operations
   - `shared/services/storage/` - AsyncStorage wrapper
   - `shared/services/auth/` - Authentication services
4. WHEN organizing shared components THEN the system SHALL create subdirectories:
   - `shared/components/forms/` - Form-related components
   - `shared/components/navigation/` - Navigation components
   - `shared/components/layout/` - Layout and container components
   - `shared/components/ui/` - Basic UI elements

### Requirement 3: File Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing files to be moved to their appropriate locations in the new structure, so that no functionality is lost during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating screens THEN each screen file SHALL be moved to its corresponding feature's `screens/` directory
2. WHEN migrating store slices THEN each Redux slice SHALL be moved to its corresponding feature's `store/` directory
3. WHEN migrating services THEN feature-specific services SHALL be moved to their feature's `services/` directory
4. WHEN migrating types THEN feature-specific types SHALL be moved to their feature's `types/` directory
5. WHEN migrating utilities THEN feature-specific utilities SHALL be moved to their feature's `utils/` directory
6. WHEN identifying shared code THEN cross-cutting concerns SHALL be moved to the `shared/` directory
7. WHEN migrating components THEN feature-specific components SHALL be moved to their feature's `components/` directory

### Requirement 4: Import Reference Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements to be updated to reflect the new file locations, so that the application continues to function correctly after the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating imports THEN all relative import paths SHALL be updated to reflect new file locations
2. WHEN updating imports THEN all absolute import paths SHALL be updated using the configured path aliases
3. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken import references exist
4. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL maintain proper dependency relationships between features
5. WHEN updating imports THEN shared code imports SHALL use the `@shared/` path alias
6. WHEN updating imports THEN feature code imports SHALL use feature-specific path aliases

### Requirement 5: Path Alias Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use clean import paths with aliases, so that imports are readable and maintainable regardless of file nesting depth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring path aliases THEN the system SHALL update `tsconfig.json` with new path mappings
2. WHEN defining aliases THEN the system SHALL create aliases for each feature module:
   - `@features/transactions/*` → `src/features/transactions/*`
   - `@features/instagram/*` → `src/features/instagram/*`
   - `@features/wtregistry/*` → `src/features/wtregistry/*`
   - `@features/calendar/*` → `src/features/calendar/*`
   - `@features/notes/*` → `src/features/notes/*`
   - `@features/tasks/*` → `src/features/tasks/*`
   - `@features/history/*` → `src/features/history/*`
3. WHEN defining aliases THEN the system SHALL create aliases for shared code:
   - `@shared/*` → `src/shared/*`
   - `@shared/components/*` → `src/shared/components/*`
   - `@shared/services/*` → `src/shared/services/*`
   - `@shared/store/*` → `src/shared/store/*`
   - `@shared/types/*` → `src/shared/types/*`
   - `@shared/utils/*` → `src/shared/utils/*`
   - `@shared/hooks/*` → `src/shared/hooks/*`
4. WHEN configuring Metro bundler THEN the system SHALL update `metro.config.js` to support the new path aliases

### Requirement 6: Feature Independence

**User Story:** As a developer, I want features to be as independent as possible, so that changes to one feature don't unexpectedly affect other features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing features THEN features SHALL NOT directly import from other features
2. WHEN features need shared functionality THEN they SHALL import from the `shared/` directory
3. WHEN features need to communicate THEN they SHALL use Redux store or shared services
4. WHEN organizing feature stores THEN each feature SHALL have its own Redux slice
5. WHEN organizing feature types THEN each feature SHALL define its own domain-specific types

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to continue working exactly as before the migration, so that no functionality is broken or lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work identically
2. WHEN migration is complete THEN all screens SHALL be accessible through navigation
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN all Redux state management SHALL function correctly
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN all API calls SHALL work as expected
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN all theme and styling SHALL be preserved
6. WHEN migration is complete THEN all TypeScript compilation SHALL succeed without errors

### Requirement 8: Build System Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to work correctly with the new structure, so that development and production builds continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for development THEN Metro bundler SHALL resolve all new import paths correctly
2. WHEN building for production THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN running TypeScript compiler THEN all path aliases SHALL be resolved correctly
4. WHEN running linting tools THEN they SHALL work with the new directory structure
5. WHEN running tests THEN test files SHALL be able to import from the new locations

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Structure Creation
- Create new directory structure
- Set up path aliases in configuration files

### Phase 2: Shared Code Migration
- Move cross-cutting concerns to `shared/` directory
- Update imports for shared code

### Phase 3: Feature Code Migration
- Move feature-specific code to respective feature directories
- Update imports for feature code

### Phase 4: Import Reference Updates
- Update all import statements throughout the codebase
- Verify no broken references exist

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- Test all functionality to ensure nothing is broken
- Verify build processes work correctly
- Update any remaining configuration files

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. ✅ All code is organized in the new feature-first structure
2. ✅ All import references are updated and working
3. ✅ The application builds and runs without errors
4. ✅ All existing functionality works identically to before
5. ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
6. ✅ Path aliases are properly configured and working
7. ✅ Features are properly isolated with minimal cross-dependencies
8. ✅ Shared code is easily accessible from all features

## Risk Mitigation

- **Import Errors**: Systematic approach to updating imports with verification at each step
- **Broken Functionality**: Thorough testing after each migration phase
- **Build Issues**: Update configuration files before moving code
- **Merge Conflicts**: Complete migration in a single comprehensive change
